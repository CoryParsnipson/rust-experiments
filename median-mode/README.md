# median-mode

This is a suggested exercise found at the end of [Section 8.3](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch08-03-hash-maps.html) of the official rust lang book.

Given a list of integers, use a vector and return the median (when sorted, the value in the middle position) and mode (the value that occurs most often; a hash map will be helpful here).

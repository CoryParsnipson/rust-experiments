Guessing game exercise from [Section 2](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html) of the official rust lang book.

This is a simple exercise with some branching flow control to get acquainted with rust. This program generates a random integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and then prompts for a number from the user. The game will tell you if the guess is too big or too small and repeatedly prompt for new guesses until the user guesses the correct number. The program will exit in that case.

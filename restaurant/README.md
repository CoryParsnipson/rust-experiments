# restaurant

This is an example program from [Section 7](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch07-00-managing-growing-projects-with-packages-crates-and-modules.html) of the official rust lang book.

This is a simple program that defines a module called "restaurant" that contains two nested modules and functions. This is to get users familiar wth modules, path syntax, packages, and access modifiers (public, private, etc).
